# Face-Recognition
This face recognition model is designed to identify individuals based on facial images. It employs a Siamese network architecture, which is particularly effective for tasks involving similarity comparison between pairs of inputs. The model is trained to distinguish between the facial features of different individuals and is capable of predicting the identity of a person from a given image.
